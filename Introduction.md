# For the audience who would like to participate
 - Quick note, the commands I mention are to be run in the terminal/console of your respective machine
    - Another quick note! Don't run in a jupyter notebook

## Head over to my project's repository
 - Look for `fork` option near upper right corner
     - Do not change repository name
     - Check the `Copy the main branch only` option
     - Create fork
 - `clone` the fork `your_repo/project-serrano-a`
     - Why `clone`? Think about it like the first official pull
     - Connects your work with mine
 - `cd` into `project-serrano-a`
 - create a new branch utilizing:
     - `git checkout -b "branch_name" `
 - Create a new file *__OR__* edit one of my existing `.md` files
 - add/commit/push your edits to main branch
 - copy/paste the `upstream` message into your directory
     - what this `upstream` command does is push your commit to the `main` branch, in this case, `DS385Fall22/project-serrano-a`
