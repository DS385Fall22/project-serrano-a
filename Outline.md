# Presentation Outline:

## Give a brief introduction of what I'm presenting 
 - Branches in Git
 - Centralized Workflow & Feature Branch Workflow
 
## Show example of Edward's cloned repository of `bridgestan`
 - Since I have a cloned repository of `bridgestan`, execute following:
     - `git log --graph --decorate --online`
     - Will be utilizing the branching illustration of the terminal so audience can visualize how workflows `flow`, pun intended
         - Sidenote: Note that Edward's copy of `bridgestan` is a combination of a Central and Feature Branch
         - Sidenote: Its not just his work, he's working with two other individuals
## Ask class to participate in an activity to showcase branches 
 - If members participate, go through steps outlined in `Introduction.md`
 - If not, oh wells their loss.
